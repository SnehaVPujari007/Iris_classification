# SMS Spam Classification

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). The project uses Python and several machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, to preprocess the text data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a spam classifier using machine learning techniques. The model takes a text message as input and classifies it as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages, with features extracted from the text (such as word counts, TF-IDF scores, etc.).

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. Each message is a short text, and it is either marked as spam or ham based on its content. The data can be found in the `data/` directory (or you can use your own labeled dataset).

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

Required Python libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk matplotlib seaborn

```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project and start using it:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnehaVPujari007/sms-spam-classification.git

```
## Model Training

The model is trained using a text preprocessing pipeline and a classification algorithm. Below is an overview of the training process:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- The dataset is cleaned by removing any non-alphabetic characters and converting all text to lowercase.
- The text data is tokenized, and stopwords are removed using NLTK's stopwords list.
- Features are extracted using the **TF-IDF vectorizer**, which converts the text data into a numerical representation.

### 2. Model Selection

The model is trained using a machine learning algorithm, such as:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Hyperparameters are tuned for optimal performance using **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

### 3. Saving the Model

After training, the model is saved to disk using either **joblib** or **pickle**. This allows the trained model to be reloaded and used for future predictions without retraining.

```python
import joblib

# Saving the model
joblib.dump(model, 'spam_classifier_model.pkl')

```
